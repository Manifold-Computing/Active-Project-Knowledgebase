This folder is for research notes related to real world missions, either past or planned, which will incorporate some degree of distributed coordination and/or autonomy.
Notes on these missions should include these aspects:
* Mission Statement - What the purpose of the mission is i.e. the question it seeks to answer or problem it seeks to solve.
* Outcome - How successful the mission was and what it accomplished from the mission statement, as well as future plans.
* Mision Parameters - The physical parameters of the mission such as dates when the mission was active, orbital parameters, launch vehicle and deployment method, etc.
* Hardware - Brief description of the hardware and physical architecture of the computing systems, sensors, instruments, etc. onboard the spacecraft. Should be as brief as possible.
* ADC Implementation - How autonomy and/or distributed coordination were implemented onboard this spacecraft. Mission specific implementation details are not as important as the general approaches and concepts used to achieve ADC.
