This folder is for research notes on theoretical papers relating to spacecraft autonomy and/or distributed coordination. 
The materials in this folder should pose a problem and then a potential solution.
Research notes on these papers should detail these aspects of the corresponding paper:
  * Problem Statement - A concise version of the problem the paper poses a solution to or is centered upon.
  * Conclusion - The degree to which the authors of the paper were successful in their proposed solution, and the errors/shortcomings/further work related to their approach.
  * Background - The brief history and technical background needed to understand the context of the proposed solution.
  * Mechanism - Finally, the actual mechanism of the paper i.e. how their solution is supposed to work.
