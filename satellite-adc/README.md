# Satellite Autonomous Distributed Coordination
## Goal
The aim of this project is to facilitate the coordination of satellites for purposes including but not limited to: scientific missions, orbital construction, earth monitoring, space monitoring, etc.
This project is interdisciplinary, and will combine orbital mechanics and other environmental constraints with multi-agent coordination methods, such as reinforcement learning, stigmergy or a distributed command heirarchy.
## Status
Currently in active stage. Still reviewing literature on multi-agent coordination methods as well as records of prior mission which have implemented some part of this goal. However, first version of roadmap is complete as well as first, starter experiment. In the process of conducting further experiments.
