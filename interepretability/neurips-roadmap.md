# Collection of ideas for the interpretability project for NeurIPS 2021

## Current Ideas:
- Scale up architectures (Efficient Nets and Deeper ResNets) on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100.
- Scale up dataset (Imagenet) on current architectures (ResNets).
- Scale up architectures and Datasets.

## New Ideas:

### Atharva
- Explore other tasks: Object Detection, Segmentation, etc.
- Create a wide study instead of a deep one where we explore multiple vision tasks.
- This could be a great contribution while being tractable (we can choose simpler benchmarks that are easy to train)
